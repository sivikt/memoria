Memoria is a C++14 framework providing general purpose dynamic data structures on top of key-value, object, file or block storage. Out of the box the following data structures are provided: map, vector, multimap, table, wide table and some others. Besides basic data structures there are also advanced ones: searchable sequences and wavelet trees. Many others can be designed using building blocks provided by the framework.


See [instructions](https://bitbucket.org/vsmirnov/memoria/wiki/Eclipse_IDE_instructions) to setup the project in Eclipse IDE.
